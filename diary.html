      <h1 class="special">Week #1</h1>
      <h2>Thursday</h2>
      <p class="diary">CJCA is on HTB.
I am super excited because this certification is exactly what I needed.
I want to start preparing for the exam right now. This is my Day 1.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>
    
      <p class="diary">I enrolled to become an HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity Associate.
I received my welcome letter. *cheers*
I want to learn 5 more modules because they are included
in the Information Security Founda&shy;tions and SOC Analyst Prerequi&shy;sites Skill Paths.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

      <h2>Friday</h2>
      <p class="diary">I am really happy to have been able to complete Introduction to Information Security!
I found the first two sections much more challenging than the other parts.
The module helped to deepen my understanding of basic concepts.

        <h1>Week #2</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">This is not my first attempt to use HTB Academy.
Before they released CJCA, I completed 6 (of 20) modules
from the current path. But I do not remember much,
except that learning on HTB was always extremely daunting
and time-consuming for me. I think by creating the new modules
and adding them to a beginner path, they opened
the door to beginners like me.

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I like how Network Foundations explained topics
that other study resources do not cover clearly.
The Skill Assessment really enhanced it.
It was creative and extremely useful.
Thanks for sharing it!
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Today I was learning the first half of Introduction to Networking.
It was a good idea to put it after the Network Foundations
module because of its complexity. The best part was when I had
to make calculations. I try to analyze, comprehend,
and practice what I learn.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">As a beginner, it was great to read the experiences of
someone who has already done penetration testing in
real-world networks. Introduction to Network&shy;ing
covered many topics. I hope I will be able to fully
understand every detail over time.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Thanks for creating Intro to Academy!
It is good to keep in mind the underlying
logic of how our learning journey is designed.

        <h1>Week #3</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I am working on Linux Fundamen&shy;tals.
I feel lucky because I already have a little
experience with the operating system.
Others have to start from scratch.
I am using Linux daily.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Linux Fundamentals is one of the best modules on
HTB Academy. It comprehensively covers many
important topics in one place.
It is worth the time to work through each section.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Yesterday, I could not finish Linux Fundamentals as I expected.
Because I had completed it in the past (before they created CJCA),
there was not a single record of this anomaly.
I still wanted to note it somewhere. I finished it today (+1 day).
I could still work through the beginning of Introduction
to Bash Scripting. It took me much less time than I thought.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I found Introduction to Bash Scripting clear and useful.
I have experience in programming, and it helped me to
pick up the basics very fast.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working on Learning Process today.
I am thinking about practicing with several easy
machines in HTB Labs before taking the exam.
It could significantly increase my preparation time
but improve my skills. I have no idea if it is
necessary to pass successfully.
