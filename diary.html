    <p class="diary">I enrolled to become a HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity Associate.
I received my welcome letter. *cheers*
I want to learn 5 more modules because they are included
in the Information Security Foundations and SOC Analyst Prerequisites Skill Paths.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.
