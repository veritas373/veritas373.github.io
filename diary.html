      <p class="diary">I enrolled to become an HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity Associate.
I received my welcome letter. *cheers*
I want to learn 5 more modules because they are included
in the Information Security Founda&shy;tions and SOC Analyst Prerequi&shy;sites Skill Paths.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.

      <p class="diary">I am really happy to be able to complete Introduction to Information Security!
I found the first two sections much more challenging than other parts.
The module helped me to deepen my understanding in basic concepts.
