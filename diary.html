      <h1 class="special">Week #1</h1>
      <h2>Thursday</h2>
      <p class="diary">CJCA is on HTB.
I am super excited because this certification is exactly what I needed.
I want to start preparing for the exam right now. This is my Day 1.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>
    
      <p class="diary">I enrolled to become an HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity Associate.
I received my welcome letter. *cheers*
I want to learn 5 more modules because they are included
in the Information Security Founda&shy;tions and SOC Analyst Prerequi&shy;sites Skill Paths.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

      <h2>Friday</h2>
      <p class="diary">I am really happy to have been able to complete Introduction to Information Security!
I found the first two sections much more challenging than the other parts.
The module helped to deepen my understanding of basic concepts.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h1>Week #2</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">This is not my first attempt to use HTB Academy.
Before they released CJCA, I completed 6 (of 20) modules
from the current path. But I do not remember much,
except that learning on HTB was always extremely daunting
and time-consuming for me. I think by creating the new modules
and adding them to a beginner path, they opened
the door to beginners like me.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I like how Network Foundations explained topics
that other study resources do not cover clearly.
The Skill Assessment really enhanced it.
It was creative and extremely useful.
Thanks for sharing it!
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Today I was learning the first half of Introduction to Networking.
It was a good idea to put it after the Network Foundations
module because of its complexity. The best part was when I had
to make calculations. I try to analyze, comprehend,
and practice what I learn.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">As a beginner, it was great to read the experiences of
someone who has already done penetration testing in
real-world networks. Introduction to Network&shy;ing
covered many topics. I hope I will be able to fully
understand every detail over time.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Thanks for creating Intro to Academy!
It is good to keep in mind the underlying
logic of how our learning journey is designed.

        <h1>Week #3</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I am working on Linux Fundamen&shy;tals.
I feel lucky because I already have a little
experience with the operating system.
Others have to start from scratch.
I am using Linux daily.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Linux Fundamentals is one of the best modules on
HTB Academy. It comprehensively covers many
important topics in one place.
It is worth the time to work through each section.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Yesterday, I could not finish Linux Fundamentals as I expected.
Because I had completed it in the past (before they created CJCA),
there was not a single record of this anomaly.
I still wanted to note it somewhere. I finished it today (+1 day).
I could still work through the beginning of Introduction
to Bash Scripting. It took me much less time than I thought.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I found Introduction to Bash Scripting clear and useful.
I have experience in programming, and it helped me to
pick up the basics very fast.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working on Learning Process today.
I am thinking about practicing with several easy
machines in HTB Labs before taking the exam.
It could significantly increase my preparation time
but improve my skills. I have no idea if it is
necessary to pass successfully.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h1>Week #4</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Learning Process was a very interesting module for me
because of the coincidences. I usually think and
analyze myself. I disagree on many points with
the author because I often have a different
perspective, but it was still worth to read through it.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I would like to be good at multiple operating systems
and not stick to one. Windows is frequently used during
penetration tests. A lot of people encounter it daily.
I decided to practice a little with Active Directory
after working on Windows Fundamentals today.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Windows Fundamentals lets us peek into the world of system
administrators. I am planning to return to it multiple times
(even after finishing). It can serve as a foundation for
many additional exercises.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Today, Introduction to Windows Command Line
was a nice surprise. They noted the expected
time for completing it at my normal pace.
I think this is the first module that is suitable
for absolute beginners, and not just for beginners.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Introduction to Windows Com&shy;mand Line is simply just amazing.
The authors not only explained Windows concepts very well
in this module, but also gave me great help with other
CJCA modules. I feel that they truly understand
me as a beginner.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h1>Week #5</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">We will see how I will be able to finish the job role path.
I try to finish modules in two days and mini modules in one day.
Sometimes, there are deviations. For example, I have solved
some exercises in the Introduction to Active Directory.
I am waiting to start it so much, but the time has not come yet.<br><br>
Sometimes, I do the exercises before the readings,
then return to the same questions after the readings.
On Friday, I had answered every question on the
Skill Assessment except one. The last one took me more time
than I expected. My schedule noted to finish the module on Friday.
I decided to hit the Finish button, write the review,
and mark it as an overlap. (I think there will be overlaps
in the future too. A similar thing happened with the
Linux Fundamentals module previously.)<br><br>
Today, I was working on Web Requests and I was reading parts
from Introduction to Windows Command Line too.
By the way, there are very challenging parts in multiple
modules for me. I keep returning to the unclear parts and try
to understand and research them more in depth.
I try to search for topics that will be very important for the exam.
For example, how to create a report properly.<br><br>
I noticed some modules are much harder,
and some modules are much easier.
I try my best to take the challenge.
I do not think the modules are appropriate
for absolute beginners because they are too difficult for them.
I would share only a few of them with absolute beginners,
and only after recommend them multiple sources to read.
HTB Academy can be really tough.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Web Requests helped me to become more comfortable using cURL.
It increased my knowledge regarding HTTP headers too.
I am happy that it is a part of CJCA job role path.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working on Introduction to Web Applications today.
It was easy for me because I can program, so I started
learning about the MITRE ATT&CK<sup>&reg;</sup> Framework.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Introduction to Web Applica&shy;tions made sure to give a solid
foundation before moving to web penetration testing.
Previous knowledge about the topic made it much clearer.
It is really worth the time.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was super excited to start Introduction to Active Direct&shy;ory,
and this is the day to start it officially!
I hope I will be able to work with ADs in the future.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h1>Week #6</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working hard to finish Introduction to Active Direct&shy;ory.
It is half past midnight but it was still worth it.
This is my review on HTB Academy:<br><br>
Thanks for creating Introduc&shy;tion to Active Directory!
This topic is very new to me. I want to specialize
in Active Directory later on.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I became sad after reading the post of an intermediate
HTB certification holder. The author decided to take
the CJCA exam (even if it is for beginners).
It looks like the learning path will not be enough
to pass the exam successfully. I decided to start
Intro to Network Traffic Analysis instead of
Introduc&shy;tion to Penetration Testing.
I no longer trust the order of modules.
I will figure out whether to first take the exam
or practice labs with a break before the real exam.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working on Intro to Network Traffic Analysis today.
I have not used tcpdump yet. I do not have much previous
experience with Wireshark either. I decided to give it
an additional day.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Intro to Network Traffic Analysis was a very useful
module, as blue teaming is very new to me.
I could understand it comfortably.
It showed me useful basic information.
Previous Linux, web development,
and networking knowledge was useful.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I started Incident Handling Process today. I downloaded
the NIST Special Publication related to Incident Handling.
I finished Intro to Network Traffic Analysis in three days.
It was not hard, but I really need to develop proper blue
teaming technical skills before the exam.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>
        
        <h1>Week #7</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
<p class="diary">Incident Handling Process was a gentle introduction for me.
Blue teamers have a very interesting job. I can imagine
their daily life better now.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I started Security Monitoring & SIEM Fundamentals today.
It is after the Incident Handling Process in the CDSA
job-role path. I decided not to follow the module
order in CJCA after reading that the Blue Teaming
part will be very difficult on the exam.
Defensive security is new to me. I want to understand
it properly. If I start it sooner, I will have more
time to keep returning to it. I know Elastic is a
very important topic. It is better to get used to
it sooner than later. The Security Monitoring & SIEM
Fundamentals module includes it.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">This was my first real encounter with Elastic. First, nothing seemed
to work as I expected. Then, it became more comfortable rapidly.
Thanks for creating Security Monitor&shy;ing and SIEM Fundamentals!
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I started Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil. I could understand it
more after completing Security Monitoring and SIEM Fundamentals.
It was a good idea to follow the module order in the CDSA path
(instead of CJCA). It is a mini-module, but I still found it tricky.
I want to give it enough time, so I will play with it tomorrow too.<br><br>
I was reading comments about other HTB exams.
It looks like previous experience is always necessary.
I am planning to solve several labs before buying my voucher.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was working on Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil.
I was too optimistic at the beginning of the day
because I started another module (Introduction to
Threat Hunting & Hunting With Elastic) too.
I could not complete every exercise in Windows Event
Logs & Finding Evil. I searched a bit, and others have
difficulty too. I will keep working on it until I
overcome all the obstacles.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h1>Week #8</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">In my previous post, I mentioned that I could not finish the last
two mini-modules on time. I was in a difficult situation.
I decided to continue my normal schedule while keep working
on them. This way I do not need to finish the job-role
path much later, I only need to solve a few exercises sometimes.
Today, I started the Introduction to Penetration Testing module,
as expected.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Introduction to Penetration Testing covered many topics.
It was useful to read advice about possible first jobs,
or to read information about the different areas.
I am happy that the author shared his expertise with us.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Today, I decided to continue with Network Enumeration
with Nmap. I played with Sherlocks in HTB Labs too.
I try to get more comfortable with defensive security.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Network Enumeration with Nmap is a very important module for me
while preparing for the CJCA exam. Penetration testers use it daily,
so I want to become good at it. I like that the module includes
evasion techniques too.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was studying Pentest in a Nutshell today. HTB Labs will increase
prices next month. I am thinking about buying a VIP annual
subscription instead of a CJCA exam voucher.
I have never done any HTB exam yet, but HTB Academy
assumes previous knowledge a lot of times. I guess, those can
be right who say HTB Labs is a must for the exams (or a decent
amount of previous experience). I do not want to risk not passing.
I read about writing reports and practiced Sherlocks too.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h1>Week #9</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary" style="text-align: center;">[ One Week Off ]</p>

        <h1>Week #10</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was too positive. I thought, I would be able to do the ten weeks in one sitting.
It did not happen. I could manage eight weeks. Then, I had a week off.
This is my Week #10. I was thinking a lot. If I attempt to complete the last two
weeks in one week, it will not be effective. I will not spend enough time
on the remaining modules. Quantity is not everything. Quality counts too.<br><br>

The other thing is that I have no idea how fast I will be. Maybe,
a little rest could be a great idea, but I want to continue the challenge.
I have no idea when I can complete the HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity
Associate's Job Role Path, but I will do my best. I will keep going until
I can tackle the challenge.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

    <p class="diary">I kept studying after midnight. I could complete the Pentest in a Nutshell module.<br><br>

This is a great module with not just technical details. Beginners
really need a helping hand before creative challenges. Reading
this module after a few months will be easy for me. Now,
I could spend my energy better to understand the information more.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b> <b>#reviews</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I realized that I need only one more module to complete the Information
Security Foundations Skill Path. I worked on Setting Up today.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">It was great to see how professional penetration testers prepare
their environments before real-world engagements. Thanks for
sharing Setting Up with us!

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Yesterday, I could successfully complete the Information
Security Foundations Skill Path. Today, I started working
on Intro to Assembly Language. It is the last module of
the SOC Analyst Prerequisites Skill Path. It might take
longer than two days.

        <h1>Week #12</h1>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I could do my first eight weeks as I planned it. One module usually took
me two days. Then difficulties happened. First, I thought the best approach
was to take a week off. I could continue studying one more week.
Then I could not continue my normal routine again. I had a second week off.<br><br>

I realized that I cannot continue like that. I changed my approach.
Yes, I cannot spend the same amount of time on the modules as previously,
but I want to complete them! Based on the original schedule, I only need
my last week. I am so close. I decided to handle the situation by giving
the modules twice the amount of time. I am not happy about it, but this way,
hopefully, I can finish the end of the path consistently.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">Yesterday I started Footprint&shy;ing. I continued it today.
I am happy to learn. It was a good idea to change my study plan.
I hope four days will be enough. I still want to complete the
path, even in smaller steps.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I could study a little today too. HTB will have a live stream on
YouTube about CJCA tomorrow. Cry0l1t3 and 21y4d will be there.
I have no idea if I can participate in the event or just watch
the stream later. If anyone can go online at 9:00 AM CST,
they will be able to ask the creators.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p class="diary">After watching the HTB CJCA stream today, I am 100% sure that
I have to complete several Machines and Sherlocks before the exam.
They implied that an absolute beginner without any previous
knowledge could start the learning path. I do not agree with
this at all. I highly respect the technical details that they
share, and I am very happy that they made the modules affordable
because this way people can access high-quality content.
But I do not have the same opinion all the time.
I want to minimize the risk and be able to pass the exam on
the first attempt. I do not want to hit the wall when they ask
something much harder that they did not cover previously.

        <p class="diary">I started Using the Metasploit Framework today. This is the last
module that I have not read yet. I bought an annual HTB Labs VIP
subscription instead of a CJCA exam voucher last month. I am
planning to solve a lot of easy Machines and Sherlocks.
When I was working on the Hacking WordPress Skill Assessment,
I found it much easier because of my previous lab experience.
I guess it can make the exam smoother too.
<b>#HTB</b> <b>#CJCA</b></p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p class="diary">I was thinking a lot. I am persistent and really want to finish the path.
I have completed 21 of 25 modules. Using the Metasploit Framework does
not seem hard, but I have three other unfinished modules. If one module
is missing, the whole path is incomplete. For example, I only need to
answer one more question to complete Footprinting. I am sure I cannot
measure exactly how many days I need to be able to move forward, so
I decided to add a note only when a change happens from this point.
Thank you for reading about my journey. I had an intensive 13 weeks

        <p class="diary">Last Friday, I did not expect I could finish the learning
path soon. But I could complete it. I finished it today.<br><br>
In my diary, this is my "Week #14," but I noticed I studied
only two days in my first week. I started the learning
path on Thursday (July 24, 2025). I studied three days
in my last week, so it ended on Wednesday (Oct 22, 2025).
So it did not take me 14 weeks (2+3=5); it took me 13 weeks.
I had two weeks when I could not study.<br><br>
So I studied 11 weeks intensively and I had 2 weeks off.
First, I was worried every time when I did not finish before midnight,
but I think it can happen when you do something that you
really like. I tried not to learn on weekends.<br><br>
I still cannot comprehend I finished the path. I think
I will write a new post later.
