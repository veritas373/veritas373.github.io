    <p class="diary">CJCA has been released to beginners on HTB.
I am super excited because this certification is exactly what I needed.
I want to start preparing for the exam right now. This is my Day 1.

    <p class="diary">I enrolled to become a HTB Certified Cybersecurity Associate.
I have received a welcome email. *cheers*
I decided to learn 5 additional modules because they are in
the Information Security Foundations and
SOC Analyst Prerequisites.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.
