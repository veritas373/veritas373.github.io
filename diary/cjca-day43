I was too positive. I thought, I would be able to do the ten weeks in one sitting.
It did not happen. I could manage eight weeks. Then, I had a week off.
This is my Week #10. I was thinking a lot. If I attempt to complete the last two
weeks in one week, it will not be effective. I will not spend enough time
on the remaining modules. Quantity is not everything. Quality counts too.

The other thing is that I have no idea how fast I will be. Maybe,
a little rest could be a great idea, but I want to continue the challenge.
I have no idea when I can complete the HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity
Associate's Job Role Path, but I will do my best. I will keep going until
I can tackle the challenge.
