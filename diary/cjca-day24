I became sad after reading the post of an intermediate
HTB certification holder. The author decided to take
the CJCA exam (even if it is for beginners).
It looks like the learning path will not be enough
to pass the exam successfully. I decided to start
Intro to Network Traffic Analysis instead of
Introduction to Penetration Testing.
I no longer trust the order of modules.
I will figure out whether to first take the exam
or practice labs with a break before the real exam.
