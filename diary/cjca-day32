I was working on Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil.
I was too optimistic at the beginning of the day
because I started another module (Introduction to
Threat Hunting & Hunting With Elastic) too.
I could not complete every exercise in Windows Event
Logs & Finding Evil. I searched a bit, and others have
difficulty too. I will keep working on it until I
overcome the obstacles.
