Last Friday, I did not expect I could finish the learning
path soon. But I could complete it. I finished it today.
In my diary, this is my "Week #14," but I noticed I studied
only two days in my first week. I started the learning
path on Thursday (July 24, 2025). I studied three days
in my last week, so it ended on Wednesday (Oct 22, 2025).
So it did not take me 14 weeks (2+3=5); it took me 13 weeks.

First, I was worried every time when I did not finish
before midnight, but I think it can happen when you do
something that you really like. I had two weeks when I
did not learn. I tried my best to not learn on weekends.
I still cannot comprehend I finished the path. I think
I will write a new post later.
