Yesterday, I could not finish Linux Fundamentals as I expected.
Because I had completed it in the past (before they created CJCA),
there was not a single record of this anomaly.
I still wanted to note it somewhere. I finished it today (+1 day).
I could still work through the beginning of Introduction
to Bash Scripting. It took me much less time than I thought.
