I was thinking a lot. I am persistent and really want to finish the path.
I have completed 21 of 25 modules. Using the Metasploit Framework does
not seem hard, but I have three other unfinished modules. If one module
is missing, the whole path is incomplete. For example, I only need to
answer one more question to complete Footprinting. I am sure I cannot
measure exactly how many days I need to be able to move forward, so
I decided to add a note only when a change happens from this point.
Thank you for reading about my journey. I had an intensive 13 weeks
(I had 2 weeks off, so it was actually 11 weeks).
