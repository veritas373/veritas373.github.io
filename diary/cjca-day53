I could do my first eight weeks as I planned it. One module usually took
me two days. Then difficulties happened. First, I thought the best approach
was to take a week off. I could continue studying one more week.
Then I could not continue my normal routine again. I had a second week off.

I realized that I cannot continue like that. I changed my approach.
Yes, I cannot spend the same amount of time on the modules as previously,
but I want to complete them! Based on the original schedule, I only need
my last week. I am so close. I decided to handle the situation by giving
the modules twice the amount of time. I am not happy about it, but this way,
hopefully, I can finish the end of the path consistently.
