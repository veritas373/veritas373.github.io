We will see how I will be able to finish the job role path.
I try to finish modules in two days and mini modules in one day.
Sometimes, there are deviations. For example, I have solved
some exercises in the Introduction to Active Directory.
I am waiting to start it so much, but the time has not come yet.
Sometimes, I do the exercises before the readings,
then return to the same questions after the readings.
On Friday, I had answered every question on the
Skill Assessment except one. The last one took me more time
than I expected. My schedule noted to finish the module on Friday.
I decided to hit the Finish button, write the review,
and mark it as an overlap. (I think there will be overlaps
in the future too. A similar thing happened with the
Linux Fundamentals module previously.)
Today, I was working on Web Requests and I was reading parts
from Introduction to Windows Command Line too.
By the way, there are very challenging parts in multiple
modules for me. I keep returning to the unclear parts and try
to understand and research them more in depth.
I try to search for topics that will be very important for the exam.
For example, how to create a report properly.
I noticed some modules are much harder,
and some modules are much easier.
I try my best to take the challenge.
I do not think the modules are appropriate
for absolute beginners because they are too difficult for them.
I would share only a few of them with absolute beginners,
and only after recommend them multiple sources to read.
HTB Academy can be really tough.
