I started Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil. I could understand it
more after completing Security Monitoring and SIEM Fundamentals.
It was a good idea to follow the module order in the CDSA path
(instead of CJCA). It is a mini-module, but I still found it tricky.
I want to give it enough time, so I will play with it tomorrow too.
I was reading comments about other HTB exams.
It looks like previous experience is always necessary.
I am planning to solve several labs before buying my voucher.
