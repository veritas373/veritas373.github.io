I started Security Monitoring & SIEM Fundamentals today.
It is after the Incident Handling Process in the CDSA
job-role path. I decided not to follow the module
order in CJCA after reading that the Blue Teaming
part will be very difficult on the exam.
Defensive security is new to me. I want to understand
it properly. If I start it sooner, I will have more
time to keep returning to it. I know Elastic is a
very important topic. It is better to get used to
it sooner than later. The Security Monitoring & SIEM
Fundamentals module includes it.
