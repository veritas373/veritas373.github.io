I was studying Pentest in a Nutshell today. HTB Labs will increase
prices next month. I am thinking about buying a VIP annual
subscription instead of a CJCA exam voucher.
I have never done any HTB exam yet, but HTB Academy
assumes previous knowledge a lot of times. I guess, those can
be right who say HTB Labs is a must for the exams (or a decent
amount of previous experience). I do not want to risk not passing.
I was reading about Report Writing and practicing with Sherlocks too.
