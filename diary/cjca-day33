In my previous post, I mentioned that I could not finish the last
two mini-modules on time. I was in a difficult situation.
I decided to finish them while I continued my normal schedule.
I can accept working on them by solving a few exercises
simultaneously, but I do not want to finish the job-role
path much later. Today, I started the Introduction to
Penetration Testing module, as expected.
