In my previous post, I mentioned that I could not finish the last
two mini-modules on time. I was in a difficult situation.
I decided to continue my normal schedule while keep working
on them. This way I do not need to finish the job-role
path much later, I only need to solve a few exercises sometimes.
Today, I started the Introduction to Penetration Testing module,
as expected.
