This is not my first attempt to use HTB Academy.
Before they released CJCA, I completed 6 (of 20) modules
from the current path. But I do not remember much,
except that learning on HTB was always extremely daunting
and time-consuming for me. I think by creating the new modules
and adding them to a beginner path, they opened
the door to beginners like me.
