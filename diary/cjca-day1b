I enrolled to become an HTB Certified Junior Cybersecurity Associate.
I received my welcome letter. *cheers*
I want to learn 5 more modules because they are included in
the Information Security Foundations and
SOC Analyst Prerequisites Skill Paths.
I really want to become a well-rounded professional.
