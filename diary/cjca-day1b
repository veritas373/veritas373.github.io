I enrolled in the <b>HTB Certified Cybersecurity Associate</b>'s Job Role Path.
I decided to add 5 additional modules to my studies because they were included in the <b>Information Security Foundations</b> and <b>SOC Analyst Prerequisites</b> Skill Paths.
I really want to become a full-rounded professional.
