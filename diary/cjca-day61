I started Using the Metasploit Framework today. This is the last
module that I have not read yet. I bought an annual HTB Labs VIP
subscription instead of a CJCA exam voucher last month. I am
planning to solve a lot of easy Machines and Sherlocks.
When I was working on the Hacking WordPress Skill Assessment,
I found it much easier because of my previous lab experience.
I guess it can make the exam smoother too.
