After watching the HTB CJCA stream today, I am 100% sure that
I have to complete several Machines and Sherlocks before the exam.
They implied that an absolute beginner without any previous
knowledge could start the learning path. I do not agree with
this at all. I highly respect the technical details that they
share, and I am very happy that they made the modules affordable
because this way people can access high-quality content.
But I do not have the same opinion all the time.
I want to minimize the risk and be able to pass the exam on
the first attempt. I do not want to hit the wall when they ask
something much harder that they did not cover previously.
