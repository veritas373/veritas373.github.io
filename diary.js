            I am super excited because this certification is \
            exactly what I needed. I want to start preparing \

            Associate's Job Role Path. I decided to add \
            5 additional modules to my plans because they are \
            included in the Information Security Foundations \
            and SOC Analyst Prerequisites Skill Paths. \
